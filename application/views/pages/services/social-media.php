        <h1>Social Media</h1>

        <p>Over 50% of all Australians check their social media over 5 times a day with Facebook users spending the equivalent of one full working day a week on the site, at 8.5 hours per week.</p>

        <p>Online engagement from companies through social media can play a key role in converting viewers to followers with over 62% of people proving open to change their views on a company if it is responding directly to negative feedback on social media.*</p>
